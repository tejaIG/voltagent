**VoltAgent** is an open source TypeScript framework for building and orchestrating AI agents.
You can build production-ready agents with memory, workflows, tools, and built-in LLM observability.

## Why VoltAgent?

- **Production-Ready from Day One**: Ship agents with built-in memory, workflows, and observability instead of building infrastructure from scratch.
- **Code with Confidence**: Full TypeScript support with type-safe tools, automatic inference, and compile time safety across your entire agent system.
- **Debug Like a Pro**: Built-in VoltOps observability lets you trace every decision, monitor performance, and optimize workflows in real-time without external tools.
- **Build Complex Systems Simply**: Orchestrate multi-agent teams with supervisor coordination, declarative workflows, and modular architecture that scales from prototypes to production.

## Agent Development Platform

VoltAgent provides a complete platform for developing and monitoring AI agents through two complementary tools.

For end-to-end walkthroughs (e.g., Slack agent), see the [Recipes & Guides](/recipes-and-guides/) section.

### Core Framework

With the core framework, you can build intelligent agents with memory, tools, and multi-step workflows while connecting to any AI provider. Create sophisticated multi-agent systems where specialized agents work together under supervisor coordination.

### Core Framework Example

```tsx
import { VoltAgent, Agent } from "@voltagent/core";
import { honoServer } from "@voltagent/server-hono";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "my-voltagent-app",
  instructions: "A helpful assistant that answers questions without using tools",
  // VoltAgent uses the AI SDK directly - pick any ai-sdk model
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});

// Serve your agent over HTTP (default port 3141)
new VoltAgent({
  agents: { agent },
  server: honoServer(),
});
```

### Workflow Engine Example

```typescript
import { createWorkflowChain, andThen, andAgent, Agent } from "@voltagent/core";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { z } from "zod";

// First, define an agent to be used in the workflow
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "summarizer-agent",
  instructions: "You are an expert at summarizing text.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});

// Then, create the workflow that uses the agent
const analysisWorkflow = createWorkflowChain({
  id: "text-analysis-workflow",
  name: "Text Analysis Workflow",
  input: z.object({ text: z.string() }),
  result: z.object({
    summary: z.string(),
    summaryWordCount: z.number(),
  }),
})
  // Step 1: Prepare the data
  .andThen({
    name: "trim-text",
    execute: async (data) => ({
      trimmedText: data.text.trim(),
    }),
  })
  // Step 2: Call the AI agent for analysis
  .andAgent(
    (data) => `Summarize this text in one sentence: "${data.trimmedText}"`,
    agent, // Uses the agent defined above
    {
      schema: z.object({ summary: z.string() }),
    }
  )
  // Step 3: Process the AI's output
  .andThen({
    name: "count-summary-words",
    execute: async (data) => ({
      summary: data.summary,
      summaryWordCount: data.summary.split(" ").length,
    }),
  });
```

### Actions & Integrations

Connect agent or workflow outputs to external systems without writing custom plumbing. VoltOps ships with an **Actions** catalog (first release: Airtable) that you can explore from the console, test in place, and then call directly from code.

- Use the **Actions** drawer in VoltOps Console to pick an integration, select a credential, and provide sample payload values.
- Run the real provider test from the drawer, inspect the response, and copy the generated SDK snippet.
- Paste the snippet into your agent or workflow and replace the sample values with runtime data.

```ts
import { createVoltOpsClient } from "@voltagent/core";

const voltops = createVoltOpsClient({
  publicKey: process.env.VOLT_PUBLIC_KEY!,
  secretKey: process.env.VOLT_SECRET_KEY!,
});

await voltops.actions.airtable.createRecord({
  credential: { credentialId: "cred_abc123" },
  baseId: "appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  tableId: "tblYYYYYYYYYYYY",
  fields: {
    Name: "Ada Lovelace",
    Email: "ada@example.com",
  },
  typecast: true,
});
```

Bindings run inside VoltOps with observability, retries, and can be attached to agents or workflows using JSON transform templates. Additional providers will land in the same experience.

### VoltOps LLM Observability Platform

VoltAgent comes with built-in [VoltOps](/voltops-llm-observability-docs/) LLM observability to monitor and debug your agents in real-time with detailed execution traces, performance metrics, and visual dashboards. Inspect every decision your agents make, track tool usage, and optimize your workflows with built-in OpenTelemetry-based observability.
